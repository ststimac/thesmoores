					Shortly after The S’Moores group came into existence, Nepal was hit by a massive earthquake and aftershocks that devastated the area. 
					I wanted to do something to help and was so impressed with how kind and positive Toby’s fans were, that I decided to initiate a fundraising contest to 
					aid in relief efforts in Nepal.  I posted on our Twitter page asking S’Moores to give any amount they could in Toby’s honor to UNICEF, The Red Cross, Global Giving, 
					and/or the Tzu Chi Foundation and then tweet that they had made a donation using #SmooresForNepal to be entered into a raffle. At that point in time, the raffle prizes 
					were fairly small in scale and something I was still putting together.
				</p>
				<p class="body-copy">
					A few hours after my post, Toby reached out to ask me: "How can I contribute/help out with this Nepal drive?"  His readiness to help and the way he offered
					to do it perfectly illustrates the kind of man he is.  It wasn’t: "Cool idea, kid" or "Let me know if you need anything." He pro-actively offered to help in whatever way 
					I needed/wanted him to and was enthusiastic, encouraging, and terribly humble about the whole thing. I asked if he would be willing to autograph photos for the winners of 
					the raffle.  Not only did he happily agree to do this, he also offered to donate a Daredevil poster signed by cast members for the grand prize winner. Despite being very busy, 
					he took the time to personalize the autographed photos once the winners had been drawn.
				</p>
				<p class="body-copy">With Toby’s support, the unwavering help of Jolan Farkas, and the amazing contributions from the S’Moores, we raised over $1,500 for relief efforts in Nepal. 
					And that’s just the amount I was able to track. I know even more than that was donated and I am so proud of what we accomplished as a group. 
					I am continually impressed by the generosity and kindness of our group and I look forward to doing more together in the future!
